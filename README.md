Welcome to {Company}.

I’m an Engineering Manager here, my job is to help you do yours. This help is built on three pillars: focus, guidance and support. 

# Pillars

### Focus. 
Making sure you have the time and headspace to be effective, as well as providing guidance on where the focus might be best directed. 

### Guidance. 
Providing mentoring so that you can develop in your current role and in your career.  This is only possible with the support to push oneself and tackle new challenges. 

### Support. 
Being a sounding board, understanding your needs and ensuring an environment where mistakes are an opportunity to learn. 

These three pillars rely on strong communication, both on the individual and the team level. Built on a foundation of continuous two way feedback, weekly 1:1s and a weekly staff meeting.  

# Foundation

### Feedback
It’s crucial to recognize success and identify failure, and this is a two way street.  I aim to deliver praise frequently and publicly, it brings joy to my day when I can recognize a job well done. If you would prefer a more subtle approach, I can tone it down and keep it for our 1:1s. I’ll let you know of any negative feedback privately, so that we can work together on what went wrong and how to improve for next time. I’d appreciate it if you let me know of my faults in a similar manner. 

### 1:1s
I put at least 30 minutes aside each week for all my direct reports. These are some of the most important meetings I attend.  A 1:1 is an opportunity for you to have my undivided attention, and while I might have news to share or feed back that merited face to face time, the meeting is yours.  As such I encourage you to think about what you want to discuss beforehand. 

### Staff meeting
This is a weekly meeting with the whole team, in which we can cover any topic that affects everyone. It’s an opportunity to keep in sync about problems, solutions and everything in between.

### Work-life
While my primary focus is you at work; it is my belief that only with a healthy work life balance can you be an effective human.  As such I don’t expect people to work, or respond to communication outside of normal hours unless it’s been previously agreed to, ie. You are on a weekly support rota.

### Leadership
I don’t have a monopoly on leadership. Everyone in the team has a voice, and I hope to foster a space where they can be heard. 

### Quality 
Everyone is responsible for quality, we should care for the things we build, and how we do so. 

### Communication & Transparency
Communication is a large part of being a successful ~~software engineer~~ human. Meeting’s are an important tool but they don’t scale well, instead I favour the asynchronous and public style of communication that a tool like slack offers.  While on slack I aim for all my conversations to be public, DM’s are reserved for private feedback, not project/work conversations. If a meeting must take place, notes should capture any valuable information and be shared publicly so those that couldn’t attend can benefit.

### Meetings
I go to a lot of them. If invited to one I expect it to have an agenda and that each attendee needs to be there. If a project board or other medium could replace the meeting then it probably should. I expect them to start on time.
